# FoodPair.v0 Ingredient Recommender using Word2Vec

This repository contains a simple application that uses the Word2Vec model to recommend similar ingredients based on the user's selection. The application provides a user-friendly interface where you can select up to 6 ingredients, and it will display a list of recommended ingredients that are similar to the selected ones.

## How It Works

The application utilizes the Gensim library to load a pre-trained Word2Vec model that has learned to represent words (in this case, ingredients) in a high-dimensional vector space. The model captures semantic relationships between words, allowing it to find ingredients that are similar in meaning or context.
